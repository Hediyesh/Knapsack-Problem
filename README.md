# Knapsack-Problem
In the Knapsack Problem there are items with weights and values and a knapsack that can carry a limited weight. The goal is choosing a subset of items that maximize the total value, without exceeding the weight limit. 
This project is in c# and there are 2 versions: 
1- a simple one that htere is a bag with weights and values. 
1- a more complex one with double weights. Here the items can be picked by percentage.
