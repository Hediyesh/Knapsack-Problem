# Knapsack-Problem
In the Knapsack Problem there are items with weights and values and a knapsack that can carry a limited weight. The goal is choosing a subset of items that maximize the total value, without exceeding the weight limit. This is in c# and there are 2 versions: a simple one and another with double weight that the items can be picked by percentage.
